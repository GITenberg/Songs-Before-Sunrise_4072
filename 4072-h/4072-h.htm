<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO</span><br
/>
JOSEPH MAZZINI</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Take</span>, since you bade
it should bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These, of the seed of your sowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blossom or berry or weed.<br />
Sweet though they be not, or fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the dew of your word kept growing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet at least was the seed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Men bring you love-offerings of tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sorrow the kiss that assuages,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And slaves the hate-offering of
wrongs,<br />
And time the thanksgiving of years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And years the thanksgiving of ages;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bring you my handful of
songs.</p>
<p class="poetry">If a perfume be left, if a bloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let it live till Italia be risen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be strewn in the dust of her
car<br />
When her voice shall awake from the tomb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; England, and France from her prison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sisters, a star by a star.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>I bring you the sword of a song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword of my spirit&rsquo;s desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeble; but laid at your feet,<br
/>
That which was weak shall be strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That which was cold shall take fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That which was bitter be
sweet.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was wrought not with hands to smite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor hewn after swordsmiths&rsquo; fashion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor tempered on anvil of steel;<br
/>
But with visions and dreams of the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But with hope, and the patience of passion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the signet of love for a
seal.</p>
<p class="poetry">Be it witness, till one more strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till a loftier lyre, till a rarer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lute praise her better than I,<br
/>
Be it witness before you, my song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I knew her, the world&rsquo;s banner-bearer,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall cry the republican
cry.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, even she as at first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, she alone and none other,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall cast down, shall build up,
shall bring home;<br />
Slake earth&rsquo;s hunger and thirst,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lighten, and lead as a mother;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First name of the world&rsquo;s
names, Rome.</p>

3</span>PRELUDE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Between</span> the green
bud and the red<br />
Youth sat and sang by Time, and shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From eyes and tresses flowers and tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From heart and spirit hopes and fears,<br />
Upon the hollow stream whose bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is channelled by the foamless years;<br />
And with the white the gold-haired head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed running locks, and in Time&rsquo;s ears<br />
Youth&rsquo;s dreams hung singing, and Time&rsquo;s truth<br />
Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Between the bud and the blown flower<br />
Youth talked with joy and grief an hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With footless joy and wingless grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And twin-born faith and disbelief<br />
Who share the seasons to devour;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And long ere these made up their sheaf<br />
Felt the winds round him shake and shower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rose-red and the blood-red leaf,<br />
Delight whose germ grew never grain,<br />
And passion dyed in its own pain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then he stood up, and trod to dust<br />
Fear and desire, mistrust and trust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bound for sandals on his feet<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Knowledge
and patience of what must<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And what things may be, in the heat<br />
And cold of years that rot and rust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And alter; and his spirit&rsquo;s meat<br />
Was freedom, and his staff was wrought<br />
Of strength, and his cloak woven of thought.</p>
<p class="poetry">For what has he whose will sees clear<br />
To do with doubt and faith and fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swift hopes and slow despondencies?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart is equal with the sea&rsquo;s<br />
And with the sea-wind&rsquo;s, and his ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is level to the speech of these,<br />
And his soul communes and takes cheer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the actual earth&rsquo;s equalities,<br />
Air, light, and night, hills, winds, and streams,<br />
And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams.</p>
<p class="poetry">His soul is even with the sun<br />
Whose spirit and whose eye are one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who seeks not stars by day, nor light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And heavy heat of day by night.<br />
Him can no God cast down, whom none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can lift in hope beyond the height<br />
Of fate and nature and things done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the calm rule of might and right<br />
That bids men be and bear and do,<br />
And die beneath blind skies or blue.</p>
<p class="poetry">To him the lights of even and morn<br />
Speak no vain things of love or scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fancies and passions miscreate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By man in things dispassionate.<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Nor holds he
fellowship forlorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With souls that pray and hope and hate,<br />
And doubt they had better not been born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fain would lure or scare off fate<br />
And charm their doomsman from their doom<br />
And make fear dig its own false tomb.</p>
<p class="poetry">He builds not half of doubts and half<br />
Of dreams his own soul&rsquo;s cenotaph,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths, rise<br />
And dance and wring their hands and laugh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs,<br />
And without living lips would quaff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The living spring in man that lies,<br />
And drain his soul of faith and strength<br />
It might have lived on a life&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p class="poetry">He hath given himself and hath not sold<br />
To God for heaven or man for gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or grief for comfort that it gives,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or joy for grief&rsquo;s restoratives.<br />
He hath given himself to time, whose fold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuts in the mortal flock that lives<br />
On its plain pasture&rsquo;s heat and cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the equal year&rsquo;s alternatives.<br />
Earth, heaven, and time, death, life, and he,<br />
Endure while they shall be to be.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Yet between death and life are hours<br
/>
To flush with love and hide in flowers;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What profit save in these?&rdquo; men cry:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, see, between soft earth and sky,<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>What only
good things here are ours!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They say, &ldquo;what better wouldst thou try,<br />
What sweeter sing of? or what powers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Serve, that will give thee ere thou die<br />
More joy to sing and be less sad,<br />
More heart to play and grow more glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Play then and sing; we too have played,<br />
We likewise, in that subtle shade.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We too have twisted through our hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear,<br />
And heard what mirth the M&aelig;nads made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the wind blew our garlands bare<br />
And left their roses disarrayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And smote the summer with strange air,<br />
And disengirdled and discrowned<br />
The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound.</p>
<p class="poetry">We too have tracked by star-proof trees<br />
The tempest of the Thyiades<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scare the loud night on hills that hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood-feasts of the Bassarid,<br />
Heard their song&rsquo;s iron cadences<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fright the wolf hungering from the kid,<br />
Outroar the lion-throated seas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outchide the north-wind if it chid,<br />
And hush the torrent-tongued ravines<br />
With thunders of their tambourines.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim<br />
Dim goddesses of fiery fame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cymbal and clamorous kettledrum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Timbrels and tabrets, all are dumb<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>That turned
the high chill air to flame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The singing tongues of fire are numb<br />
That called on Cotys by her name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Edonian, till they felt her come<br />
And maddened, and her mystic face<br />
Lightened along the streams of Thrace.</p>
<p class="poetry">For Pleasure slumberless and pale,<br />
And Passion with rejected veil,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass, and the tempest-footed throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hours that follow them with song<br />
Till their feet flag and voices fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lips that were so loud so long<br />
Learn silence, or a wearier wail;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So keen is change, and time so strong,<br />
To weave the robes of life and rend<br />
And weave again till life have end.</p>
<p class="poetry">But weak is change, but strengthless time,<br

To take the light from heaven, or climb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hills of heaven with wasting feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs they can stop that earth found meet,<br />
But the stars keep their ageless rhyme;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowers they can slay that spring thought sweet,<br

But the stars keep their spring sublime;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Passions and pleasures can defeat,<br />
Actions and agonies control,<br />
And life and death, but not the soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">Because man&rsquo;s soul is man&rsquo;s God

and shoals of good and ill;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And still its flame at mainmast height<br />
Through the rent air that foam-flakes fill<br />

Whence only man hath strength to steer<br />
Or helm to handle without fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">Save his own soul&rsquo;s light overhead,<br />
None leads him, and none ever led,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across birth&rsquo;s hidden harbour-bar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past youth where shoreward shallows are,<br />
Through age that drives on toward the red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vast void of sunset hailed from far,<br />
To the equal waters of the dead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save his own soul he hath no star,<br />
And sinks, except his own soul guide,<br />
Helmless in middle turn of tide.</p>
<p class="poetry">No blast of air or fire of sun<br />
Puts out the light whereby we run<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With girded loins our lamplit race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And each from each takes heart of grace<br />
And spirit till his turn be done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And light of face from each man&rsquo;s face<br />
In whom the light of trust is one;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since only souls that keep their place<br />
By their own light, and watch things roll,<br />
And stand, have light for any soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">A little time we gain from time<br />
To set our seasons in some chime,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; With seasons played out long ago<br />

that in their time and prime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took part with summer or with snow,<br />
Lived abject lives out or sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And had their chance of seed to sow<br />
For service or disservice done<br />
To those days daed and this their son.</p>
<p class="poetry">A little time that we may fill<br />
Or with such good works or such ill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As loose the bonds or make them strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein all manhood suffers wrong.<br />
By rose-hung river and light-foot rill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There are who rest not; who think long<br />
Till they discern as from a hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the sun&rsquo;s hour of morning song,<br />
Known of souls only, and those souls free,<br />
The sacred spaces of the sea.</p>

The daysprings and the watersprings that flow<br />

burns again<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; A rose renewed with red new life begun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dragged down
with thorns and briers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That puts forth
buds like fires<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the whole tree take flower in unison,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And prince that clogs and priest

Be cast as weeds upon the dunghill of dead things.</p>

Session in Rome of the Ecumenical Council</span>)</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the grey
beginning of years, in the twilight of things that began,<br />
The word of the earth in the ears of the world, was it God? was
it man?<br />
The word of the earth to the spheres her sisters, the note of her
song,<br />
The sound of her speech in the ears of the starry and sisterly
throng,<br />
Was it praise or passion or prayer, was it love or devotion or
dread,<br />
When the veils of the shining air first wrapt her jubilant
head?<br />
When her eyes new-born of the night saw yet no star out of
reach;<br />
When her maiden mouth was alight with the flame of musical
speech;<br />
When her virgin feet were set on the terrible heavenly way,<br />
And her virginal lids were wet with the dew of the birth of the
day:<br />
Eyes that had looked not on time, and ears that had heard not of
death;<br />
Lips that had learnt not the rhyme of change and passionate
breath,<br />
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The
rhythmic anguish of growth, and the motion of mutable things,<br
/>
Of love that longs and is loth, and plume-plucked hope without
wings,<br />
Passions and pains without number, and life that runs and is
lame,<br />
From slumber again to slumber, the same race set for the same,<br
/>
Where the runners outwear each other, but running with lampless
hands<br />
No man takes light from his brother till blind at the goal he
stands:<br />
Ah, did they know, did they dream of it, counting the cost and
the worth?<br />
The ways of her days, did they seem then good to the new-souled
earth?<br />
Did her heart rejoice, and the might of her spirit exult in her
then,<br />
Child yet no child of the night, and motherless mother of men?<br
/>
Was it Love brake forth flower-fashion, a bird with gold on his
wings,<br />
Lovely, her firstborn passion, and impulse of firstborn
things?<br />
Was Love that nestling indeed that under the plumes of the
night<br />
Was hatched and hidden as seed in the furrow, and brought forth
bright?<br />
Was it Love lay shut in the shell world-shaped, having over him
there<br />
Black world-wide wings that impel the might of the night through
air?<br />
And bursting his shell as a bird, night shook through her
sail-stretched vans,<br />
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>And her
heart as a water was stirred, and its heat was the firstborn
man&rsquo;s.<br />
For the waste of the dead void air took form of a world at
birth,<br />
And the waters and firmaments were, and light, and the
life-giving earth.<br />
The beautiful bird unbegotten that night brought forth without
pain<br />
In the fathomless years forgotten whereover the dead gods
reign,<br />
Was it love, life, godhead, or fate? we say the spirit is one<br
/>
That moved on the dark to create out of darkness the stars and
the sun.<br />
Before the growth was the grower, and the seed ere the plant was
sown;<br />
But what was seed of the sower? and the grain of him, whence was
it grown?<br />
Foot after foot ye go back and travail and make yourselves
mad;<br />
Blind feet that feel for the track where highway is none to be
had.<br />
Therefore the God that ye make you is grievous, and gives not
aid,<br />
Because it is but for your sake that the God of your making is
made.<br />
Thou and I and he are not gods made men for a span,<br />
But God, if a God there be, is the substance of men which is
man.<br />
Our lives are as pulses or pores of his manifold body and
breath;<br />
As waves of his sea on the shores where birth is the beacon of
death.<br />
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>We men,
the multiform features of man, whatsoever we be,<br />
Recreate him of whom we are creatures, and all we only are he.<br

Not each man of all men is God, but God is the fruit of the
whole;<br />
Indivisible spirit and blood, indiscernible body from soul.<br />
Not men&rsquo;s but man&rsquo;s is the glory of godhead, the
kingdom of time,<br />
The mountainous ages made hoary with snows for the spirit to
climb.<br />
A God with the world inwound whose clay to his footsole
clings;<br />
A manifold God fast-bound as with iron of adverse things.<br />
A soul that labours and lives, an emotion, a strenuous breath,<br
/>
From the flame that its own mouth gives reillumed, and refreshed
with death.<br />
In the sea whereof centuries are waves the live God plunges and
swims;<br />
His bed is in all men&rsquo;s graves, but the worm hath not hold
on his limbs.<br />
Night puts out not his eyes, nor time sheds change on his
head;<br />
With such fire as the stars of the skies are the roots of his
heart are fed.<br />
Men are the thoughts passing through it, the veins that fulfil it
with blood,<br />
With spirit of sense to renew it as springs fulfilling a
flood.<br />
Men are the heartbeats of man, the plumes that feather his
wings,<br />

of things.<br />
Things are cruel and blind; their strength detains and
deforms:<br />
And the wearying wings of the mind still beat up the stream of
their storms.<br />
Still, as one swimming up stream, they strike out blind in the
blast,<br />
In thunders of vision and dream, and lightnings of future and
past.<br />
We are baffled and caught in the current and bruised upon edges
of shoals;<br />
As weeds or as reeds in the torrent of things are the wind-shaken
souls.<br />
Spirit by spirit goes under, a foam-bell&rsquo;s bubble of
breath,<br />
That blows and opens in sunder and blurs not the mirror of
death.<br />
For a worm or a thorn in his path is a man&rsquo;s soul quenched
as a flame;<br />
For his lust of an hour or his wrath shall the worm and the man
be the same.<br />
O God sore stricken of things! they have wrought him a raiment of
pain;<br />
Can a God shut eyelids and wings at a touch on the nerves of the
brain?<br />
O shamed and sorrowful God, whose force goes out at a blow!<br />
What world shall shake at his nod? at his coming what wilderness
glow?<br />
What help in the work of his hands? what light in the track of
his feet?<br />
His days are snowflakes or sands, with cold to consume him and
heat.<br />

Folly and force, and a sword that devours, and a ravening

their will;<br />
Lest Change bow down as his slave, and the storm and the sword be
still;<br />
Lest earth spread open her wings to the sunward, and sing with
the spheres;<br />
Lest man be master of things, to prevail on their forces and
fears.<br />
By the spirit are things overcome; they are stark, and the spirit
hath breath;<br />
It hath speech, and their forces are dumb; it is living, and
things are of death.<br />
But they know not the spirit for master, they feel not force from
above,<br />
While man makes love to disaster, and woos desolation with
love.<br />
Yea, himself too hath made himself chains, and his own hands
plucked out his eyes;<br />
For his own soul only constrains him, his own mouth only
denies.<br />
The herds of kings and their hosts and the flocks of the high
priests bow<br />
To a master whose face is a ghost&rsquo;s; O thou that wast God,
is it thou?<br />
Thou madest man in the garden; thou temptedst man, and he
fell;<br />

By the balefires of ages that burn for thine incense, by creed
and by rood,<br />
By the famine and passion that yearn and that hunger to find of
thee food,<br />
By the children that asked at thy throne of the priests that were
fat with thine hire<br />
For bread, and thou gavest a stone; for light, and thou madest
them fire;<br />
By the kiss of thy peace like a snake&rsquo;s kiss, that leaves
the soul rotten at root;<br />
By the savours of gibbets and stakes thou hast planted to bear to
thee fruit;<br />
By torture and terror and treason, that make to thee weapons and
wings;<br />
By thy power upon men for a season, made out of the malice of
things;<br />
O thou that hast built thee a shrine of the madness of man and
his shame,<br />
And hast hung in the midst for a sign of his worship the lamp of
thy name;<br />
That hast shown him for heaven in a vision a void world&rsquo;s
shadow and shell,<br />
And hast fed thy delight and derision with fire of belief as of

With anguish of dreams to deceive them whose faith cries out in

Thou art judged, O judge, and the sentence is gone forth against
thee, O God.<br />
Thy slave that slept is awake; thy slave but slept for a span;<br

Yea, man thy slave shall unmake thee, who made thee lord over

The sun rearisen is his priest, and the heat thereof hallows his

Asks no more witness or warning from temple or tripod or tree.<br

He hath set the centuries at union; the night is afraid at his
name;<br />
Equal with life, in communion with death, he hath found them the
same.<br />
Past the wall unsurmounted that bars out our vision with iron and
fire<br />
He hath sent forth his soul for the stars to comply with and suns
to conspire.<br />
His thought takes flight for the centre wherethrough it hath part
in the whole;<br />
The abysses forbid it not enter: the stars make room for the
soul.<br />

day;<br />

thought give place?<br />
Is the body not more than the vesture, the life not more than the

The will than the word or the gesture, the heart than the hands

Men perish, but man shall endure; lives die, but the life is not

Before the blind first hour of time had birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before night knew the moonlight or the morn;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where no leaf came to blossom from no root;</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Inside</span> this northern
summer&rsquo;s fold<br />
The fields are full of naked gold,<br />
Broadcast from heaven on lands it loves;<br />
The green veiled air is full of doves;<br />
Soft leaves that sift the sunbeams let<br />
Light on the small warm grasses wet<br />
Fall in short broken kisses sweet,<br />
And break again like waves that beat<br />
Round the sun&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I, for all this English mirth<br />
Of golden-shod and dancing days,<br />
And the old green-girt sweet-hearted earth,<br />
Desire what here no spells can raise.<br />
Far hence, with holier heavens above,<br />
The lovely city of my love<br />
Bathes deep in the sun-satiate air<br />
That flows round no fair thing more fair<br />
Her beauty bare.</p>
<p class="poetry">There the utter sky is holier, there<br />
More pure the intense white height of air,<br />
More clear men&rsquo;s eyes that mine would meet,<br />
And the sweet springs of things more sweet.<br />
<a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>There
for this one warm note of doves<br />
A clamour of a thousand loves<br />
Storms the night&rsquo;s ear, the day&rsquo;s assails,<br />
From the tempestuous nightingales,<br />
And fills, and fails.</p>
<p class="poetry">O gracious city well-beloved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian, and a maiden crowned,<br />
Siena, my feet are no more moved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward thy strange-shapen mountain-bound:<br />
But my heart in me turns and moves,<br />
O lady loveliest of my loves,<br />
Toward thee, to lie before thy feet<br />
And gaze from thy fair fountain-seat<br />
Up the sheer street;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the house midway hanging see<br />
That saw Saint Catherine bodily,<br />
Felt on its floors her sweet feet move,<br />
And the live light of fiery love<br />
Burn from her beautiful strange face,<br />
As in the sanguine sacred place<br />
Where in pure hands she took the head<br />
Severed, and with pure lips still red<br />
Kissed the lips dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">For years through, sweetest of the saints,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In quiet without cease she wrought,<br />
Till cries of men and fierce complaints<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From outward moved her maiden thought;<br />
And prayers she heard and sighs toward France,<br />
&ldquo;God, send us back deliverance,<br />
Send back thy servant, lest we die!&rdquo;<br />
With an exceeding bitter cry<br />
They smote the sky.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Then in her sacred saving hands<br />
She took the sorrows of the lands,<br />
With maiden palms she lifted up<br />
The sick time&rsquo;s blood-embittered cup,<br />
And in her virgin garment furled<br />
The faint limbs of a wounded world.<br />
Clothed with calm love and clear desire,<br />
She went forth in her soul&rsquo;s attire,<br />
A missive fire.</p>
<p class="poetry">Across the might of men that strove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It shone, and over heads of kings;<br />
And molten in red flames of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were swords and many monstrous things;<br />
And shields were lowered, and snapt were spears,<br />
And sweeter-tuned the clamorous years;<br />
And faith came back, and peace, that were<br />
Fled; for she bade, saying, &ldquo;Thou, God&rsquo;s heir,<br />
Hast thou no care?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Lo, men lay waste thine heritage<br />
Still, and much heathen people rage<br />
Against thee, and devise vain things.<br />
What comfort in the face of kings,<br />
What counsel is there?&nbsp; Turn thine eyes<br />
And thine heart from them in like wise;<br />
Turn thee unto thine holy place<br />
To help us that of God for grace<br />
Require thy face.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For who shall hear us if not thou<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a strange land? what doest thou there?<br />
Thy sheep are spoiled, and the ploughers plough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon us; why hast thou no care<br />
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>For all
this, and beyond strange hills<br />
Liest unregardful what snow chills<br />
Thy foldless flock, or what rains beat?<br />
Lo, in thine ears, before thy feet,<br />
Thy lost sheep bleat.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And strange men feed on faultless
lives,<br />
And there is blood, and men put knives,<br />
Shepherd, unto the young lamb&rsquo;s throat;<br />
And one hath eaten, and one smote,<br />
And one had hunger and is fed<br />
Full of the flesh of these, and red<br />
With blood of these as who drinks wine<br />
And God knoweth, who hath sent thee a sign,<br />
If these were thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But the Pope&rsquo;s heart within him
burned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So that he rose up, seeing the sign,<br />
And came among them; but she turned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to her daily way divine,<br />
And fed her faith with silent things,<br />
And lived her life with curbed white wings,<br />
And mixed herself with heaven and died:<br />
And now on the sheer city-side<br />
Smiles like a bride.</p>
<p class="poetry">You see her in the fresh clear gloom,<br />
Where walls shut out the flame and bloom<br />
Of full-breathed summer, and the roof<br />
Keeps the keen ardent air aloof<br />
And sweet weight of the violent sky:<br />
There bodily beheld on high,<br />
She seems as one hearing in tune<br />
Heaven within heaven, at heaven&rsquo;s full noon,<br />
In sacred swoon:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>A solemn swoon of sense that aches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With imminent blind heat of heaven,<br />
While all the wide-eyed spirit wakes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vigilant of the supreme Seven,<br />
Whose choral flames in God&rsquo;s sight move,<br />
Made unendurable with love,<br />
That without wind or blast of breath<br />
Compels all things through life and death<br />
Whither God saith.</p>
<p class="poetry">There on the dim side-chapel wall<br />
Thy mighty touch memorial,<br />
Razzi, raised up, for ages dead,<br />
And fixed for us her heavenly head:<br />
And, rent with plaited thorn and rod,<br />
Bared the live likeness of her God<br />
To men&rsquo;s eyes turning from strange lands,<br />
Where, pale from thine immortal hands,<br />
Christ wounded stands;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the blood blots his holy hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And white brows over hungering eyes<br />
That plead against us, and the fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mute lips forlorn of words or sighs<br />
In the great torment that bends down<br />
His bruised head with the bloomless crown,<br />
White as the unfruitful thorn-flower,<br />
A God beheld in dreams that were<br />
Beheld of her.</p>
<p class="poetry">In vain on all these sins and years<br />
Falls the sad blood, fall the slow tears;<br />
In vain poured forth as watersprings,<br />
Priests, on your altars, and ye, kings,<br />
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>About

&nbsp;&nbsp; O men signed backward with his name,<br />
Beholding in Gethsemane<br />

Knowing how the word of Christian should<br />
Mean to men evil and not good,<br />
Seem to men shameful for your sake,<br />
Whose lips, for all the prayers they make,<br />
Man&rsquo;s blood must slake.</p>

Fair as the world&rsquo;s old faith of flowers,<br />

Hath Aphrodite bidden glance<br />
The lovelier lightnings of your feet?<br />
From what sweet Paphian sward or seat<br />
Led you more sweet?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; With flowerlike arms for flowery bands<br />
Your linked limbs glitter like the sun,<br />

With wreaths and Cytherean hymns?<br />
Where no lute makes luxurious<br />
The adoring airs in Amathus,<br />
Till the maid, knowing her mother near,<br />
Sobs with love, aching with sweet fear?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; A raiment of a flaming fire;<br />
And the fierce fruitless mountain stairs<br />

And through their clefts and crests the town<br />
Looks west and sees the dead sun lie,<br />
In sanguine death that stains the sky<br />
With angry dye.</p>

Late among mourning men that slept,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; The faint wind springing with the springs that

The dim sweet smell of flowering hopes, and heat<br />

<p class="poetry">I prophesy of life, who live with death;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor quick nor dead, nor flexible by fate,<br />
Nor quite of earth nor wholly of the tomb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A voice, a vision, light as fire or air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Driven between days that shall be and that were.</p>
<p class="poetry">I prophesy, with feet upon a grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of death cast out and life devouring death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As flame doth wood and stubble with a breath;<br />
Of freedom, though all manhood were one slave;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of truth, though all the world were liar; of
love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That time nor hate can raze the witness of.</p>
<p class="poetry">Life that was given for love&rsquo;s sake and
his law&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their powers have no more power on; they divide<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoils wrung from lust or wrath of man or pride,<br
/>
And keen oblivion without pity or pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets them on fire and scatters them on air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like ashes shaken from a suppliant&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p class="poetry">But life they lay no hand on; life once
given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No force of theirs hath competence to take;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Life that was given for some divine thing&rsquo;s
sake,<br />
To mix the bitterness of earth with heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Light with man&rsquo;s night, and music with his
breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dies not, but makes its living food of death.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have seen this, who live where men are

<p class="poetry">As when one wakes out of a waning dream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sees with instant eyes the naked thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereof the vision as a web was wrought,<br />
I saw beneath a heaven of cloud and gleam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere yet the heart of the young sun waxed brave,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One like a prophet standing by a grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the hoar heaven was hardly beam or
breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the coloured hills and fields were grey,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wind wandered seeking for the day,<br />
And wailed as though he had found her done to death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this grey hour had built to bury her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hollow twilight for a sepulchre.</p>
<p class="poetry">But in my soul I saw as in a glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale and living body full of grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There lying, and over it the prophet&rsquo;s face<br
/>
Fixed; and the face was not of Tiresias,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>For such a starry fire was in his eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though their light it was that made the
skies.</p>
<p class="poetry">Such eyes should God&rsquo;s have been when
very love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked forth of them and set the sun aflame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And such his lips that called the light by name<br
/>
And bade the morning forth at sound thereof;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face was sad and masterful as fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like a star&rsquo;s his look compassionate.</p>
<p class="poetry">Like a star&rsquo;s gazed on of sad eyes so
long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to yearn with pity, and all its fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As a man&rsquo;s heart to tremble with desire<br />
And heave as though the light would bring forth song;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet from his face flashed lightning on the land,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like the thunder-bearer&rsquo;s was his
hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">The steepness of strange stairs had tired his
feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed;<br />
But nothing was there in the world so sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the most bitter love, like God&rsquo;s own
grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face.</p>
<p class="poetry">Grief and glad pride and passion and sharp
shame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrath and remembrance, faith and hope and hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pitiless pity of days degenerate,<br />
Were in his eyes as an incorporate flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That burned about her, and the heart thereof<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And central flower was very fire of love.</p>
<p class="poetry">But all about her grave wherein she slept<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were noises of the wild wind-footed years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose footprints flying were full of blood and
tears,<br />
Shrieks as of M&aelig;nads on their hills that leapt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>And yelled as beasts of ravin, and their meat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the rent flesh of their own sons to eat:</p>
<p class="poetry">And fiery shadows passing with strange
cries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sphinx-like shapes about the ruined lands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the red reek of parricidal hands<br />
And intermixture of incestuous eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And light as of that self-divided flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made an end of the Cadmean name.</p>
<p class="poetry">And I beheld again, and lo the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bright body laid therein as dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the same shadow across another head<br />
That bowed down silent on that sleeping slave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was the lady of empire from her birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And light of all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Within the compass of the watcher&rsquo;s
hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All strengths of other men and divers powers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were held at ease and gathered up as flowers;<br />
His heart was as the heart of his whole land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at his feet as natural servants lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Twilight and dawn and night and labouring day.</p>
<p class="poetry">He was most awful of the sons of God.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now men seeing seemed at his lips to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trumpet of the judgment that should be,<br />
And in his right hand terror for a rod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the breath that made the mountains bow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The horned fire of Moses on his brow.</p>
<p class="poetry">The strong wind of the coming of the Lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had blown as flame upon him, and brought down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On his bare head from heaven fire for a crown,<br />
And fire was girt upon him as a sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>To smite and lighten, and on what ways he trod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There fell from him the shadow of a God.</p>
<p class="poetry">Pale, with the whole world&rsquo;s judgment in
his eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood and saw the grief and shame endure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he, though highest of angels might not cure,<br
/>
And the same sins done under the same skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the same slaves to the same tyrants thrown,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fain he would have slept, and fain been
stone.</p>
<p class="poetry">But with unslumbering eyes he watched the
sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sealed her sense whose eyes were suns of
old;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the night shut and opened, and behold,<br />
The same grave where those prophets came to weep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But she that lay therein had moved and stirred,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where those twain had watched her stood a
third.</p>
<p class="poetry">The tripled rhyme that closed in Paradise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Love&rsquo;s name sealing up its starry
speech&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tripled might of hand that found in reach<br />
All crowns beheld far off of all men&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Song, colour, carven wonders of live stone&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; These were not, but the very soul alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">The living spirit, the good gift of grace,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The faith which takes of its own blood to give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the dead veins of buried hope may live,<br />
Came on her sleeping, face to naked face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from a soul more sweet than all the south<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathed love upon her sealed and breathless
mouth.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Between her lips the breath was blown as fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through her flushed veins leapt the liquid
life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with sore passion and ambiguous strife<br />
The new birth rent her and the new desire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The will to live, the competence to be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sense to hearken and the soul to see.</p>
<p class="poetry">And the third prophet standing by her grave<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretched forth his hand and touched her, and her
eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened as sudden suns in heaven might rise,<br />
And her soul caught from his the faith to save;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faith above creeds, faith beyond records, born<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the pure, naked, fruitful, awful morn.</p>
<p class="poetry">For in the daybreak now that night was dead<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The light, the shadow, the delight, the pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose and the passion of those twain,<br />
Seemed gathered on that third prophetic head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all their crowns were as one crown, and one<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face with her face in the living sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">For even with that communion of their eyes<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His whole soul passed into her and made her
strong;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the sounds and shows of shame and wrong,<br
/>
The hand that slays, the lip that mocks and lies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Temples and thrones that yet men seem to
see&mdash;<br />

Among the chains and crowns of poisonous peace;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though not the beams that shone<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From rent Arcadion<br />
Can melt her mists and bid her snows decrease;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do thou with sudden wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darken the face of kings,<br />
But turn again the beauty of thy brows on Greece;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy white and woundless brows,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereto her great heart bows;<br

Give her the glories of thine eyes to see;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn thee, O holiest head,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toward all thy quick and dead,<br

For love&rsquo;s sake of the souls that cry for thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O love, O light, O flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By thine own Grecian name,<br />
We call thee and we charge thee that all these be free.</p>

among these,<br />
Thou of the tyrannous crew,<br />
The kingdoms fed upon blood,<br />
O queen from of old of the seas,<br />
England, art thou of them too<br />
That drink of the poisonous flood,<br />
That hide under poisonous trees?</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="poetry">Nay, thy name from of old,<br />
Mother, was pure, or we dreamed<br />
Purer we held thee than this,<br />
Purer fain would we hold;<br />
So goodly a glory it seemed,<br />
A fame so bounteous of bliss,<br />
So more precious than gold.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="poetry">A praise so sweet in our ears,<br />
That thou in the tempest of things<br />
As a rock for a refuge shouldst stand,<br />
In the bloodred river of tears<br />
Poured forth for the triumph of kings;<br />
A safeguard, a sheltering land,<br />
In the thunder and torrent of years.</p>

<p class="poetry">Strangers came gladly to thee,<br />
Exiles, chosen of men,<br />
Safe for thy sake in thy shade,<br />
Sat down at thy feet and were free.<br />
So men spake of thee then;<br />
Now shall their speaking be stayed?<br />
Ah, so let it not be!</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p class="poetry">Not for revenge or affright,<br />
Pride, or a tyrannous lust,<br />
Cast from thee the crown of thy praise.<br />
Mercy was thine in thy might;<br />
Strong when thou wert, thou wert just;<br />
Now, in the wrong-doing days,<br />
Cleave thou, thou at least, to the right.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p class="poetry">How should one charge thee, how sway,<br />
Save by the memories that were?<br />
Not thy gold nor the strength of thy ships,<br />
Nor the might of thine armies at bay,<br />
Made thee, mother, most fair;<br />
But a word from republican lips<br />
Said in thy name in thy day.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p class="poetry">Hast thou said it, and hast thou forgot?<br />
Is thy praise in thine ears as a scoff?<br />
Blood of men guiltless was shed,<br />
Children, and souls without spot,<br />
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Shed,
but in places far off;<br />

Now, but now, by thy foes,<br />

And thee would slay as they slew&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Down with her walls that enclose<br />
Freemen that eye us askance,<br />
Fugitives, men that are true!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p class="poetry">This was thy praise or thy blame<br />
From bondsman or freeman&mdash;to be<br />
Pure from pollution of slaves,<br />
Clean of their sins, and thy name<br />
Bloodless, innocent, free;<br />
Now if thou be not, thy waves<br />
Wash not from off thee thy shame.</p>

Whoso in fear for the State<br />

These things only can save.</p>

Taintless of tyranny, stands<br />
Thy mighty daughter, for years<br />
Who trod the winepress of war;<br />
Shines with immaculate hands;<br />
Slays not a foe, neither fears;<br />
Stains not peace with a scar.</p>

Thy shame as a ghost from the grave.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; One heat, of hope as of a fire;<br />
One heart, one music, and one might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One flame, one altar, and one choir;<br />
And one man&rsquo;s living head in sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who said, when all time&rsquo;s sea was foam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let there be Rome&rdquo;&mdash;and there was
Rome.</p>
<p class="poetry">As a star set in space for token<br />
Like a live word of God&rsquo;s mouth spoken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Visible sound, light audible,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the great darkness thick as hell<br />
A stanchless flame of love unsloken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sign to conquer and compel,<br />
A law to stand in heaven unbroken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereby the sun shines, and wherethrough<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s eldest empires are made new;</p>
<p class="poetry">So rose up on our generations<br />
That light of the most ancient nations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Law, life, and light, on the world&rsquo;s way,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very God of very day,<br />
The sun-god; from their star-like stations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far down the night in disarray<br />
Fled, crowned with fires of tribulations,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The suns of sunless years, whose light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And life and law were of the night.</p>
<p class="poetry">The naked kingdoms quenched and stark<br />
Drave with their dead things down the dark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Helmless; their whole world, throne by throne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fell, and its whole heart turned to stone,<br />
<a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Hopeless; their hands that touched our ark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Withered; and lo, aloft, alone,<br />
On time&rsquo;s white waters man&rsquo;s one bark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the red sundawn&rsquo;s open eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lit the soft gulf of low green sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">So for a season piloted<br />
It sailed the sunlight, and struck red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With fire of dawn reverberate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wan face of incumbent fate<br />
That paused half pitying overhead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And almost had foregone the freight<br />
Of those dark hours the next day bred<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For shame, and almost had forsworn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Service of night for love of morn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then broke the whole night in one blow,<br />
Thundering; then all hell with one throe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaved, and brought forth beneath the stroke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Death; and all dead things moved and woke<br />
That the dawn&rsquo;s arrows had brought low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the great sound of night that broke<br />
Thundering, and all the old world-wide woe;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And under night&rsquo;s loud-sounding dome<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men sought her, and she was not Rome.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still with blind hands and robes blood-wet<br
/>
Night hangs on heaven, reluctant yet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With black blood dripping from her eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the soiled lintels of the skies,<br />
With brows and lips that thirst and threat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart-sick with fear lest the sun rise,<br />
And aching with her fires that set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shuddering ere dawn bursts her bars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns out with all her beaten stars.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>In this black wind of war they fly<br />
Now, ere that hour be in the sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That brings back hope, and memory back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And light and law to lands that lack;<br />
That spiritual sweet hour whereby<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bloody-handed night and black<br />
Shall be cast out of heaven to die;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingdom by kingdom, crown by crown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fires of darkness are blown down.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet heavy, grievous yet the weight<br />
Sits on us of imperfect fate.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From wounds of other days and deeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still this day&rsquo;s breathing body bleeds;<br />
Still kings for fear and slaves for hate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sow lives of men on earth like seeds<br />
In the red soil they saturate;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we, with faces eastward set,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand sightless of the morning yet.</p>
<p class="poetry">And many for pure sorrow&rsquo;s sake<br />
Look back and stretch back hands to take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gifts of night&rsquo;s giving, ease and sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowers of night&rsquo;s grafting, strong to
steep<br />
The soul in dreams it will not break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Songs of soft hours that sigh and sweep<br />
Its lifted eyelids nigh to wake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With subtle plumes and lulling breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That soothe its weariness to death.</p>
<p class="poetry">And many, called of hope and pride,<br />
Fall ere the sunrise from our side.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh lights and rumours of fresh fames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That shift and veer by night like flames,<br />
<a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Shouts
and blown trumpets, ghosts that glide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Calling, and hail them by dead names,<br />
Fears, angers, memories, dreams divide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirit from spirit, and wear out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong hearts of men with hope and doubt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Till time beget and sorrow bear<br />
The soul-sick eyeless child despair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That comes among us, mad and blind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With counsels of a broken mind,<br />
Tales of times dead and woes that were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, prophesying against mankind,<br />
Shakes out the horror of her hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take the sunlight with its coils<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hold the living soul in toils.</p>
<p class="poetry">By many ways of death and moods<br />
Souls pass into their servitudes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their young wings weaken, plume by plume<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops, and their eyelids gather gloom<br />
And close against man&rsquo;s frauds and feuds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their tongues call they know not whom<br />
To help in their vicissitudes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For many slaveries are, but one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberty, single as the sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">One light, one law, that burns up strife,<br />
And one sufficiency of life.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-stablished, the sufficing soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hears the loud wheels of changes roll,<br />
Sees against man man bare the knife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sees the world severed, and is whole;<br />
Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fear from fraud&rsquo;s incestuous bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crawl forth and smite his father dead:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Sees death made drunk with war, sees time<br />
Weave many-coloured crime with crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; State overthrown on ruining state,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dares not be disconsolate.<br />
Only the soul hath feet to climb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the soul hath room to wait,<br />
Hath brows and eyes to hold sublime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all evil and all good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All strength and all decrepitude.</p>
<p class="poetry">She only, she since earth began,<br />
The many-minded soul of man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From one incognizable root<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That bears such divers-coloured fruit,<br />
Hath ruled for blessing or for ban<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flight of seasons and pursuit;<br />
She regent, she republican,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wide and equal eyes and wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Broods on things born and dying things.</p>
<p class="poetry">Even now for love or doubt of us<br />
The hour intense and hazardous<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangs high with pinions vibrating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereto the light and darkness cling,<br />
Dividing the dim season thus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shakes from one ambiguous wing<br />
Shadow, and one is luminous,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And day falls from it; so the past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Torments the future to the last.</p>
<p class="poetry">And we that cannot hear or see<br />
The sounds and lights of liberty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The witness of the naked God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That treads on burning hours unshod<br />
<a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>With
instant feet unwounded; we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That can trace only where he trod<br />
By fire in heaven or storm at sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not know the very present whole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And naked nature of the soul;</p>
<p class="poetry">We that see wars and woes and kings,<br />
And portents of enormous things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Empires, and agonies, and slaves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whole flame of town-swallowing graves;<br />
That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the roar of ranks like waves,<br />
From wreck to wreck as the world swings;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Know but that men there are who see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear things other far than we.</p>
<p class="poetry">By the light sitting on their brows,<br />
The fire wherewith their presence glows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The music falling with their feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet sense of a spirit sweet<br />
That with their speech or motion grows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And breathes and burns men&rsquo;s hearts with
heat;<br />
By these signs there is none but knows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men who have life and grace to give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men who have seen the soul and live.</p>
<p class="poetry">By the strength sleeping in their eyes,<br />
The lips whereon their sorrow lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling, the lines of tears unshed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The large divine look of one dead<br />
That speaks out of the breathless skies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In silence, when the light is shed<br />
Upon man&rsquo;s soul of memories;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The supreme look that sets love free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The look of stars and of the sea;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>By the strong patient godhead seen<br />
Implicit in their mortal mien,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The conscience of a God held still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thunders ruled by their own will<br />
And fast-bound fires that might burn clean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This worldly air that foul things fill,<br />
And the afterglow of what has been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That, passing, shows us without word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What they have seen, what they have heard,</p>
<p class="poetry">By all these keen and burning signs<br />
The spirit knows them and divines.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bonds, in banishment, in grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scoffed at and scourged with unbelief,<br />
Foiled with false trusts and thwart designs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stripped of green days and hopes in leaf,<br />
Their mere bare body of glory shines<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher, and man gazing surelier sees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What light, what comfort is of these.</p>
<p class="poetry">So I now gazing; till the sense<br />
Being set on fire of confidence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strains itself sunward, feels out far<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the bright and morning star,<br />
Beyond the extreme wave&rsquo;s refluence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To where the fierce first sunbeams are<br />
Whose fire intolerant and intense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As birthpangs whence day burns to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Parts breathless heaven from breathing sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">I see not, know not, and am blest,<br />
Master, who know that thou knowest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear lord and leader, at whose hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first days and the last days stand,<br />
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>With
scars and crowns on head and breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fought for love of the sweet land<br />
Or shall fight in her latter quest;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the days armed and girt and crowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose glories ring thy glory round.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thou sawest, when all the world was blind,<br
/>
The light that should be of mankind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The very day that was to be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how shalt thou not sometime see<br />
Thy city perfect to thy mind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand face to living face with thee,<br />
And no miscrowned man&rsquo;s head behind;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearth of man, the human home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The central flame that shall be Rome?</p>
<p class="poetry">As one that ere a June day rise<br />
Makes seaward for the dawn, and tries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The water with delighted limbs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That taste the sweet dark sea, and swims<br />
Right eastward under strengthening skies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sees the gradual rippling rims<br />
Of waves whence day breaks blossom-wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take fire ere light peer well above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And laughs from all his heart with love;</p>
<p class="poetry">And softlier swimming with raised head<br />
Feels the full flower of morning shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fluent sunrise round him rolled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That laps and laves his body bold<br />
With fluctuant heaven in water&rsquo;s stead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And urgent through the growing gold<br />
Strikes, and sees all the spray flash red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his soul takes the sun, and yearns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For joy wherewith the sea&rsquo;s heart burns;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>So the soul seeking through the dark<br />
Heavenward, a dove without an ark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Transcends the unnavigable sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of years that wear out memory;<br />
So calls, a sunward-singing lark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ear of souls that should be free;<br />
So points them toward the sun for mark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who steer not for the stress of waves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seek strange helmsmen, and are slaves.</p>
<p class="poetry">For if the swimmer&rsquo;s eastward eye<br />
Must see no sunrise&mdash;must put by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hope that lifted him and led<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, to have light about his head,<br />
To see beneath the clear low sky<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The green foam-whitened wave wax red<br />
And all the morning&rsquo;s banner fly&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, as earth&rsquo;s helpless hopes go down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let earth&rsquo;s self in the dark tides drown.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yea, if no morning must behold<br />
Man, other than were they now cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And other deeds than past deeds done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor any near or far-off sun<br />
Salute him risen and sunlike-souled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Free, boundless, fearless, perfect, one,<br />
Let man&rsquo;s world die like worlds of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here in heaven&rsquo;s sight only be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sole sun on the worldless sea.</p>

<p>Her pilgrimage to Avignon to recall the Pope into Italy as its
redeemer from the distractions of the time is of course the
central act of St. Catherine&rsquo;s life, the great abiding sign
of the greatness of spirit and genius of heroism which
distinguished this daughter of the people, and should yet keep
her name fresh above the holy horde of saints, in other records
than the calendar; but there is no less significance in the story
which tells how she succeeded in humanizing a criminal under
sentence of death, and given over by the priests as a soul doomed
and desperate; how the man thus raised and melted out of his
fierce and brutal despair besought her to sustain him to the last
by her presence; how, having accompanied him with comfort and
support to the very scaffold, and seen his head fall, she took it
up, and turning to the spectators who stood doubtful whether the
poor wretch could be &ldquo;saved,&rdquo; kissed it in sign of
her faith that his sins were forgiven him.&nbsp; The high and
fixed passion of her heroic temperament gives her a right to
remembrance and honour of which the miracle-mongers have done <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>their best
to deprive her.&nbsp; Cleared of all the refuse rubbish of
thaumaturgy, her life would deserve a chronicler who should do
justice at once to the ardour of her religious imagination and to
a thing far rarer and more precious&mdash;the strength and
breadth of patriotic thought and devotion which sent this girl
across the Alps to seek the living symbol of Italian hope and
unity, and bring it back by force of simple appeal in the name of
God and of the country.&nbsp; By the light of those solid and
actual qualities which ensure to her no ignoble place on the
noble roll of Italian women who have deserved well of Italy, the
record of her visions and ecstasies may be read without
contemptuous intolerance of hysterical disease.&nbsp; The
rapturous visionary and passionate ascetic was in plain matters
of this earth as pure and practical a heroine as Joan of Arc.</p>

detached wall-painting by Sodoma of the tortures of Christ bound
to the pillar, and the divine though mutilated group of the
Graces in the centre of the main hall.&nbsp; The glory and beauty
of ancient sculpture refresh and satisfy beyond expression a
sense wholly wearied and well-nigh nauseated with contemplation
of endless sanctities and agonies attempted by medi&aelig;val
art, while yet as handless as accident or barbarism has left the
sculptured goddesses.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
